\subsection{In line equations}
\label{sect.myfirst}
Writing symbols such as $Y$, $X$ or $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is easy. I can
even create a whole in-line formula, such as $Y=X\beta+\epsilon$, or even better
$\textbf{Y}=X\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$. To create spaces,
I can use the $\sim$ symbol: for instance $~~X\boldsymbol\beta~~$ has more
space than $X\boldsymbol\beta$.

adding text here is ok

Nothing to see here... yet!
\section{Text formatting}
In Section \ref{sect.myfirst} we looked at in line equations.
Good?\\ Keep these lines or exercises in a few
sections time will not make sense!
